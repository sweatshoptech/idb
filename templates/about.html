              <member-body> Hi, I am a Sunior (Junior/Senior), it is a complicated situation since I transferred to UT, Computer Science major and am extremely passionate about bridging the education gap through technology. I am a director of a club at UT called Code Orange whose sole goal is to mentor kids at low-income communties and present them with opportunities that they lack but deserve! If you are interested to join, feel free to reach out to me! <br /> Anyways, a few random facts about me are that I am loud, that I love food (particularly deep dish pizza), that I am an anime addict, that ball is literally life for me, and that I am addicted to sleep although I rarely get it :(! Last but not least, I transferred from Aggieland xD!<br /><br /></member-body>

I am cofounder and vicepresident of HACS (Hispanic Association for Computer Scientists) at UT and hope to leave a legacy in the CS department. <br /> I am a proud Mexican and Austinite girl having spent the first 9.5 years of my life in Mexico City and the other 11.5 years in Austin. I am fluent in English, Spanish and French (although slightly less fluent than English and Spanish). I spend a lot of my time trying to perfection my French every day and hope to add other languages later on. In my freetime I enjoy going to the movies, specially at the Bullock museum with their amazing IMAX screen. Finally I love spending time at the park with my puppy Chuy. <br /><br /></member-body>

              <member-body> Hi, I'm classified as a Junior at UT Austin, and I'm majoring in Computer Science. My main interests are cybersecurity and supercomputing, and I’ll be interning at BP’s Center for High Performance Computing this summer. A few words about myself - though I reside in Texas now, I was born in Missouri and lived there for 15 years before I moved here. Consequently, the weather here very frequently feels much too warm! Temperature preferences aside, in my free time I love reading (Stephen King is my favorite author), playing piano, and listening to classical and electronic music. Strangely, my favorite thing to do while coding a project is bugfixing; there’s nothing more satisfying than finding and correcting an obscure error and finally getting the program to work how you want it to work. <br /><br /></member-body>

          <h1 style="color: white;">The Problem</h1>
          <p class="paragraph-text"> Have you ever had a brilliant idea and wanted to create your own company but didn't know if a similar business already existed? Have you ever wanted to quickly find potential investors to fund your idea? Have you ever been curious about which schools had the most notable graduates from which you could recruit employees? The SWEatshop aims to aggregate, organize, and display helpful data about companies, people, investors, and schools in order to ease the process from having an idea to getting your startup up and running!</p>
          <br/>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h1 style="color: white;">The Use Cases</h1>
          <p class="paragraph-text"> A potential user of SWEatshop could be a college student who comes up with the idea of a new social network for pets and pet owners. Unfortunately, she doesn't know if there already exists such a company. Google is too vast, not specific enough, and too daunting for such a task. She can then go on sweatshop.tech, click on our companies tab and sort the companies by category. She could also look for companies with the keyword "pet" to begin her research. </p>
          <p class="paragraph-text"> Another user could be the founder of a small startup company who is in need of more investors. The founder can simply go to SWEatshop’s investor tab and start looking for investors. He could filter by categories to find companies that are similar to his, then check who invested in them. He could also search for investors by the amount of funding or even their location to find some that might best suit his business. </p>
          <p class="paragraph-text"> Say there is a company recruiter who is tasked with finding potential new interns for the summer. If he had no information to specify where to start looking, he could use SWEatshop to find schools from which his company has already recruited by filtering schools by company. He could also filter companies to find similar businesses, then check what schools they have commonly recruited from already. He could even search people to find schools from which successful employees have graduated from and start his recruiting from there. </p>
          <p class="paragraph-text"> Another use case is a CEO of a new startup in Austin who needs advice on how to run the financial aspects of his new company. Perhaps he would like to ask some advice from a peer who has experience in his business field. In SWEatshop, he can search for all sorts of people by job title, location, name, etc. In this example he could filter for CFOs who are located in Austin, TX. He then would be able to contact CFOs around Austin and be able to set up a meeting with one of them to give him some advice or maybe even meet hiring prospects. </p>

          <p class="paragraph-text"> We created an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance (virtual machine) and placed idb.py inside of it. We then used Apache2 to map the ip address of the EC2 instance to idb.py. In idb.py we utilize Flask as our backend to link the database and the HTML templates. On top of Flask we have Jinja2 which allows us to embed dynamic content through Flask onto the HTML pages. We use SQLAlchemy to model databases in Python using classes instead of plsql. It is also used to query the tables, integrate with Flask, and get data from the database which is hosted on Amazon Web Services relation database (AWS RDS). We bought the domain sweatshop.tech from Namecheap after much deliberation. We mapped the domain to the public IP and public DNS of our EC2 instance on AWS so that going to the Namecheap domain would run idb.py and Flask can route your request, connect to the AWS PostgresSQL database, and finally render the HTML templates. </p>
