    <div class="report-paragraph">
      <h3>1.1 The Problem</h3>
      <p> Have you ever had a brilliant idea and want to create your own company but don't know if something similar already exists? Who could be an investor in your company? Who could join you in this new adventure? Or simple know what schools have the most notable graduates to recruit employees from? The SWEetshop aims to make easily accesible and free everything you need to know about any company, the people it takes to fund those companies, the people who run those companies, and the institutions that educate the people behind a company.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="report-paragraph">
      <h3>1.2 What are the use cases?</h3>
      <p> A user could be a college student who one night comes up with the idea of a new social network for pets and pet owners. However, he doesn't know if there exists such a company and Google is too vast, not specific enough, and too daunting for such a task. He can then go on sweatshop.tech, click on our companies tab and sort the companies by category. Alternatively, he can filter companies by categories on social networks and pets to begin his research.</p>

          <member-body> Hi, I am a Sunior (Junior/Senior), it is a complicated situation since I transferred to UT, Computer Science major and am extremely passionate about bridging the education gap through technology. I am a director of a club at UT called Code Orange whose sole goal is to mentor kids at low-income communties and present them with opportunities that they lack but deserve! If you are interested to join, feel free to reach out to me! <br /> Anyways, a few random facts about me are that I am loud, that I love food (particularly deep dish pizza), that I am an anime addict, that ball is literally life for me, and that I am addicted to sleep although I rarely get it :(! Last but not least, I transferred from Aggieland xD!<br /><br /></member-body>

          <member-body> Hola, I am a Junior Computer Science major at UT \m/ (Hook 'em Horns). I am cofounder and vicepresident of HACS (Hispanic Association for Computer Scientists) at UT and hope to leave a legacy in the CS department. <br /> I am a proud Mexican and Austinite girl having spent the first 9.5 years of my life in Mexico City and the other 11.5 years in Austin. I am fluent in English, Spanish and French (although slightly less fluent than English and Spanish). I spend a lot of my time trying to perfection my French every day and hope to add other languages later on. In my freetime I enjoy going to the movies, specially at the Bullock museum with their amazing IMAX screen. Finally I love spending time at ther park with my puppy Chuy. <br /><br /></member-body>
